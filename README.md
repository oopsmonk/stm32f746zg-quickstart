# `stm32f746zg-quickstart`

> A template for building applications for NUCLEO-F746ZG(STM32F746ZG)

This project is based on [cortex-m-quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart).  

The STM32 **NUCLEO-F746ZG** board is a low-cost and easy-to-use development kit, used to evaluate and start a development quickly with an STM32 microcontroller in LQFP144 package. it does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.

Hardware:  
* ARM 32-bit Cortex-M7 CPU with FPU
* 216 MHz max CPU frequency
* 3 user LEDs connected on `PB0`, `PB7`, `PB14` pins
* VDD from 1.7 V to 3.6 V
* 1 MB Flash and 320 KB SRAM
* 16-bit timers(`10`) and 32-bit timers(`2`)
* SPI(`6`), I2C(`4`), I2S (`3`), USART(`4`), UART(`4`)
* USB OTG Full Speed(`1`) and High Speed(`1`)
* CAN(`2`), SAI(`2`), SPDIF_Rx(`4`), HDMI_CEC(`1`)
* Dual Mode Quad SPI(`1`)
* Camera Interface
* GPIO(up to 168) with external interrupt capability
* 12-bit ADC(`3`) with 24 channels / 2.4 MSPS
* 12-bit DAC with 2 channels(`2`)
* True Random Number Generator (RNG)
* 16-channel DMA
* LCD-TFT Controller with XGA(1024x768) resolution, 2 display layers with FIFO (64x32-bit)

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- OpenOCD and ARM GDB. Run:

```bash
$ sudo apt install gdb-multiarch openocd
```

- Rust 1.31, 1.30-beta, nightly-2018-09-13 or a newer toolchain. e.g. `rustup
  default beta`

- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate#installation).

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:

``` bash
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

**NOTE**: This is the very short version that only covers building programs. For
the long version, which additionally covers flashing, running and debugging
programs, check [the embedded Rust book][book].

[book]: https://rust-embedded.github.io/book

1. Instantiate the template.

``` bash
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/oopsmonk/stm32f746zg-quickstart
 Project Name: app
 Creating project called `app`...
 Done! New project created /tmp/app

$ cd app
```

2. Make sure compilation target is `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` in the `.cargo/config` file.

``` bash
$ tail -n6 .cargo/config
```

``` toml
[build]
# Pick ONE of these compilation targets
# target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
```

3. Check memory region information into the `memory.x` file.

``` bash
$ cat memory.x
/* Linker script for the STM32F746ZG */
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  /* NUCLEO-F746ZG memory layout */
  /* Flash 1M bytes on AXIM interface */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 1M
  /* System SRAM 320K = DTCM(64K) + SRAM1(240K) + SRAM2(16K) */
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 320K
}
```

4. Build the template application or one of the examples.

``` bash
$ cargo build
```

5. Debug on the target board.

You will need two consoles to run OpenOCD and application.  

Runs openOCD in the root of this project where the location of `openocd.cfg` and `openocd.gdb` files. 

```bash
$ sudo openocd

        http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html

```

Runs application in another console.  

```bash
$ cargo run
